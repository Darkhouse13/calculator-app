# GitHub Push Instructions

## Prerequisites
- Git is already installed and configured with your username and email
- You have a GitHub account

## Steps to Push to GitHub

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Give your repository a name (e.g., "calculator-app")
   - Leave it as a public repository (unless you want it private)
   - Do NOT initialize with a README (we already have one)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Push your local repository to GitHub:**
   - Copy the repository URL from GitHub (e.g., https://github.com/yourusername/calculator-app.git)
   - Run the following commands in your terminal:

   ```bash
   cd calculator
   git remote add origin YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

   Replace YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL with the actual URL you copied from GitHub.

3. **Verify the push:**
   - Refresh your GitHub repository page
   - You should see all your files uploaded

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
- Make sure you're using the correct repository URL
- If you get authentication errors, you might need to set up a personal access token
- If you get branch name conflicts, make sure to use the correct branch name (main or master)
