# Calculator App Deployment Instructions

## Project Status

The calculator application is fully implemented with:

- React components (Screen, Button, ButtonBox)
- CSS styling for a clean, modern UI
- Math.js for calculation engine
- Comprehensive test suite using Vitest and React Testing Library

## Deployment Steps

1. **Install Dependencies** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Tests** (recommended before deployment):
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   npx vitest run
   ```

3. **Build for Production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   ```bash
   netlify deploy
   ```

   When prompted, follow these steps:
   - Choose "Create & configure a new site"
   - Select your team
   - Choose a unique site name (or accept the random one)
   - Set the "Publish directory" to `dist`

5. **For Production Deployment** (with automatic Git integration):
   ```bash
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

## Recent Fixes
